# Chroma Key Implementation with Raspberry Pi Camera Module

This project focuses on implementing chroma key (green screen) functionality using the Raspberry Pi camera module. It includes two methods for chroma keying:

## Methods

1. **Using Green Screen:** Implement chroma keying using a traditional green screen setup.
2. **Without Green Screen:** Implement chroma keying without the use of an actual green screen.

## Requirements

To run the actual code, several imports are necessary. Additionally, you need to prepare the image you want to composite and specify its path.

## Usage

### Using Green Screen

To use the green screen method:

1. Set up your Raspberry Pi with a green screen background.
2. Run the provided script for green screen chroma keying.

### Without Green Screen

To use the chroma keying method without an actual green screen:

1. Prepare an image to composite with a clear background.
2. Run the provided script for chroma keying without a green screen.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`
- `picamera` (for interfacing with the Raspberry Pi camera module)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the scripts provided in the respective directories (`green_screen/` and `no_green_screen/`).
